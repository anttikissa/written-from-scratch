Our first task is to create a canvas that has the proper size for our
viewport.

Let's start with a simple html document:

[1/1.html]

It includes a script that creates a canvas and appends it to the document:

[1/1.js]

The <style> element guarantees that we also see where the canvas is, since
we're not yet drawing anything to it.

We'll need a server to display our little app in browser (and, eventually, other
devices). For that we write the simplest possible http server that can serve
HTML and JavaScript files:

[server.js]

Run the server by saying 'node server.js', and you should be able to see the
canvas by navigating to http://localhost:1234/1/1.html.

[[1/1.html]]

(As it often goes with the simplest possible things, the server contains a
security hole: if you create a file 'secret.txt' in the parent directory and try
to fetch '../secret.txt', the server will happily fetch it.)
